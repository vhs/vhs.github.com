		<p class='description'>		
Another Binary Day is upon us!  We shall celebrate 11/01/11 with a traditional display of beer-moistened geekery.<br /><br />
For those who have never made it, Binary Beers is a laid-back, chilled-out evening of hacking and beer, which may transition into a rambunctious night of beer and hacking.  Binary Beers are open to all, including those who have no interest in binary or beer.  Bringing a laptop or a project is a good idea, although there will inevitably be chatting, networking, and sharing of ideas.  <br /><br />
If anyone coming to Binary Beers is interested in working on the <a href='http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Global_Hackerspace_Cupcake_Challenge'>cupcake challenge</a>, let me know and I'll bake up some prototypes.  You know, for science.  <br /><br />
For anyone dedicated enough to read to the end of this email, but too busy to do the math, 11/01/11 is next Tuesday.  See you there!<br /><br />

			SHHH is a non-exclusive event intended for creative and curious people
			interested in technology. We're about knowledge sharing, technology
			exploration, and ad-hoc collaboration. Come to have fun, build things,
			learn things, and meet new people. If you've got a project you're
			working on, bring it along, or just bring yourself.  Laptops are
			recommended, unless you have something even cooler to work on.</p>
			
		<p>Ideally we'll have our makerbot cranking things out during SHHH.	</p>

        <p class='description'>VHS and myself offer a twist on hacking, it's Gender Hacking;) Don't worry, there will be no cutting and pasting of genitalia or permanent changes made to you, only a temporary blurring of lines. Come out and let's play with gender. I have an airbrush and lots of different kinds of makeup, wigs and accessories we can use. Let's explore the gender continuum by bringing out the femininity in the guys while still remaining masculine, and the masculinity out of the gals while still remaining feminine. Or as extreme as you can dream. We got cool lights on the ceiling, we'll have some music, bring some beer or bevies, and let's just have some silly fun. I don't have enough of everything for everyone, so please if you have or can borrow, outfits, hair, makeup, footwear( as I am a mens 9 1/2, womans 11) etc bring it and I will work with you to co-create your own alter ego. Good/evil, pretty/butch.....your call.  We can document this, or not;) I will also share a little of my journey with my own gender flux and it's effect on my life.

		<p class='description'>Modular origami, or unit origami, is a paperfolding technique which uses multiple sheets of paper to create a larger and more 
		complex structure than would be possible using single-piece origami techniques. Each individual sheet of paper is folded into a module, or unit, and 
		then modules are assembled into an integrated flat shape or three-dimensional structure by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding 
		process. These insertions create
		tension or friction that holds the model together.</p><br/>

				<p class='description'>August 3rd, we'll be doing the second el wire hack night.  For those who missed it, the first one was a blast.</p>
				
				<p>Why learn to work with el wire?  First, because el wire is just plain sexy (see: <a href='http://hacknmod.com/hack/create-oustanding-lighting-effects-el-wire/'>http://hacknmod.com/hack/create-oustanding-lighting-effects-el-wire/</a> ).  Second, for those coming to Burning Man this year, making some el wire gear is a great way to avoid spending your playa nights as a darkwad, also known as speed bump, or roadkill.  Same logic also applies to anyone who rides a bike in Vancouver between, say, October and March.</p>

				<p>El wire hack night isn't a formal workshop, but there will be experienced el wirers on hand to help with any questions, plus an assortment of el wire projects for inspiration. If you already have something el wired to show off, by all means bring it. Other shiny and blinky things are also welcome, even if they're not el wire based. </p>

				<p>BYO el wire, drivers, and any other paraphernalia your project requires. You can also bring just yourself if you're interested in seeing what others are up to.</p>

				<p>El wire and drivers can be found at Lee's Electronics on Main st, or bought from coolneon.com (based in California, but ship to Canada.
Very knowledgeable and great to deal with) or seattlelumin.com (based in Seattle, ships to Canada.  Haven't dealt with them personally.) </p>

				<p class='description'>Interested in making your own battery-powered portable charger for USB devices? VHS has put together kits using Lada Ada's popular Minty Boost design and will have them available for next Tuesday's kit night (Aug 10th, 2010 - 7 PM). The kit is novice level, so if you have any soldering experience at all it won't be difficult (and if you don't have any experience we can, time permitting, give you a quick run through on basic soldering). </p>
<p>The charger you will build is housed in an included Altoids container and uses two AA batteries. The Minty Boost circuit is V2 and won't work with very recent Apple devices, so check the compatibility page if you are in doubt (<a href='http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/compat2.html'>http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/compat2.html</a>).</p>
<p>Kits are $20 for members and $25 for non-members. For more information about the kit visit: <a href='http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/'>http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/</a></p>

					<h1 class='summary'>VHS Crafter Night (modular origami)</h1> 
					<p>(<time datetime="2010-07-19">Monday July 19th</time>)</p> 
				</header> 
				<p class='description'>Modular origami, or unit origami, is a paperfolding technique which uses multiple sheets of paper to create a larger and more complex structure than would be possible using single-piece origami techniques. Each individual sheet of paper is folded into a module, or unit, and then modules are assembled into an integrated flat shape or three-dimensional structure by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding process. These insertions create tension or friction that holds the model together.</p> 
				<p class='description'>We will be making one of three modular constructions of 12 or 32 units ranging from beginner to intermediate skill level. Mathew will bring some origami paper, 
but for those who want to pick up paper, Yokayaya123 in International Village (Tinseltown) or Daiso in Aberdeen mall have a large selection of 6" x 6" sheets in many colours and patterns for $2 a package of 30-100</p>

Instead of a hardware night, we're going to do a software night, where we do some Android tutorials, and cover Android Development, Contributions and how to hack your Android Device. This will be informal, and is open to all skill levels, and even those who don't have Android Devices.  I might even bring down the <a href='http://beagleboard.org/'>BeagleBoard</a>. If you like Android, and you want to talk about Android with people who like and use Android, come on down.</p>
