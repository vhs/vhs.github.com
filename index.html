				<p class='description'>Fresh from <a href='http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010'>OSCON</a>, we're going to have <a href='http://www.android.com/'>Android Night</a>. Instead of a hardware night, we're going to do a software night, where we do some Android tutorials, and cover Android Development, Contributions and how to hack your Android Device. This will be informal, and is open to all skill levels, and even those who don't have Android Devices.  I might even bring down the <a href='http://beagleboard.org/'>BeagleBoard</a>. If you like Android, and you want to talk about Android with people who like and use Android, come on down.</p>

					<h1 class='summary'>VHS Crafter Night (modular origami)</h1>
					<p>(<time datetime="2010-07-19">Monday July 19th</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<p class='description'>Modular origami, or unit origami, is a paperfolding technique which uses multiple sheets of paper to create a larger and more complex structure than would be possible using single-piece origami techniques. Each individual sheet of paper is folded into a module, or unit, and then modules are assembled into an integrated flat shape or three-dimensional structure by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding process. These insertions create tension or friction that holds the model together.</p>
				<p class='description'>We will be making one of three modular constructions of 12 or 32 units ranging from beginner to intermediate skill level. Mathew will bring some origami paper, 
but for those who want to pick up paper, Yokayaya123 in International Village (Tinseltown) or Daiso in Aberdeen mall have a large selection of 6" x 6" sheets in many colours and patterns for $2 a package of 30-100</p>

The library is designed to work as a general purpose glue, and wraps together several commonly used libraries under a tidy interface: openGL for graphics, rtAudio for audio 
input and output, freeType for fonts,freeImage for image input and output, quicktime for video playing and sequence grabbing.</p>
