				No, not the kind that helps with digestion.  The kind that you
				make into clothing!  We'll be covering spinning, knitting &amp;
				crochet.  I highly recommend learning how to spin if you don't

				you how to make your own spindle from chopsticks. All supplies

How about we tackle the following: Adding to the ceiling RGB LED lighting, connecting a PC to the light/space controller, connecting the TV and speakers to a media center so we can enjoy some ripping tunes with our new light set-up, continuing the shelving/workbench on the west wall.  Hack on everything!

				<p class='description'>August 3rd, we'll be doing the second el wire hack night.  For those who missed it, the first one was a blast.</p>
				
				<p>Why learn to work with el wire?  First, because el wire is just plain sexy (see: <a href='http://hacknmod.com/hack/create-oustanding-lighting-effects-el-wire/'>http://hacknmod.com/hack/create-oustanding-lighting-effects-el-wire/</a> ).  Second, for those coming to Burning Man this year, making some el wire gear is a great way to avoid spending your playa nights as a darkwad, also known as speed bump, or roadkill.  Same logic also applies to anyone who rides a bike in Vancouver between, say, October and March.</p>

				<p>El wire hack night isn't a formal workshop, but there will be experienced el wirers on hand to help with any questions, plus an assortment of el wire projects for inspiration. If you already have something el wired to show off, by all means bring it. Other shiny and blinky things are also welcome, even if they're not el wire based. </p>

				<p>BYO el wire, drivers, and any other paraphernalia your project requires. You can also bring just yourself if you're interested in seeing what others are up to.</p>

				<p>El wire and drivers can be found at Lee's Electronics on Main st, or bought from coolneon.com (based in California, but ship to Canada.
Very knowledgeable and great to deal with) or seattlelumin.com (based in Seattle, ships to Canada.  Haven't dealt with them personally.) </p>

				<p class='description'>Interested in making your own battery-powered portable charger for USB devices? VHS has put together kits using Lada Ada's popular Minty Boost design and will have them available for next Tuesday's kit night (Aug 10th, 2010 - 7 PM). The kit is novice level, so if you have any soldering experience at all it won't be difficult (and if you don't have any experience we can, time permitting, give you a quick run through on basic soldering). </p>
<p>The charger you will build is housed in an included Altoids container and uses two AA batteries. The Minty Boost circuit is V2 and won't work with very recent Apple devices, so check the compatibility page if you are in doubt (<a href='http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/compat2.html'>http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/compat2.html</a>).</p>
<p>Kits are $20 for members and $25 for non-members. For more information about the kit visit: <a href='http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/'>http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/</a></p>

					<h1 class='summary'>VHS Crafter Night (modular origami)</h1> 
					<p>(<time datetime="2010-07-19">Monday July 19th</time>)</p> 
				</header> 
				<p class='description'>Modular origami, or unit origami, is a paperfolding technique which uses multiple sheets of paper to create a larger and more complex structure than would be possible using single-piece origami techniques. Each individual sheet of paper is folded into a module, or unit, and then modules are assembled into an integrated flat shape or three-dimensional structure by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding process. These insertions create tension or friction that holds the model together.</p> 
				<p class='description'>We will be making one of three modular constructions of 12 or 32 units ranging from beginner to intermediate skill level. Mathew will bring some origami paper, 
but for those who want to pick up paper, Yokayaya123 in International Village (Tinseltown) or Daiso in Aberdeen mall have a large selection of 6" x 6" sheets in many colours and patterns for $2 a package of 30-100</p>
